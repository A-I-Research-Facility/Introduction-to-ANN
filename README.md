Artificial neural network creation

This repository goes from coding a simple neuron without using data manipulation tools like numpy, to advanced coding of neural networks involving batches, layers, etc. This repo is a concise form of https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX which is an overall guide on how to create a neural network from scratch in almost any language by SentDex. Be sure to check it out.
